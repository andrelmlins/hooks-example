# Hooks example

this is a repo with hooks examples like [useHooks.com](https://usehooks.com) but writing in TypeScript!

## Getting starter

I use `cra`to create a base application, then I use defaults command from him.

- `yarn start` - to starter development mode;
- `yarn build`- to build application;
- `yarn test`- to test application;
